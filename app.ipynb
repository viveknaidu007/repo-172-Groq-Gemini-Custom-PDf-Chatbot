    "Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "    Environment Setup:\n",
    "        The code starts by loading environment variables from a .env file using the dotenv library. This allows you to securely store sensitive information like API keys.\n",
    "        It imports necessary libraries, including Streamlit, Langchain components for document handling, and the Groq and Gemini integrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    API Keys:\n",
    "        It retrieves the Groq API key and sets the Google API key in the environment for use with Gemini. This is essential for authenticating API requests to access the language model's capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Streamlit UI:\n",
    "        The header and subheader are defined for the Streamlit app to give context to the user about the functionality of the app.\n",
    "        A text input field allows users to enter their questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Loading the Language Model:\n",
    "        The ChatGroq class is initialized with the Groq API key and the specified model (gemma-7b-it), enabling the application to utilize the Gemini language model for generating responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Prompt Template:\n",
    "        A prompt template is defined to instruct the model on how to respond. It includes a section for context and input questions, ensuring that the model focuses on the provided context when generating answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Vector Embedding Function:\n",
    "        The vector_embedding function handles loading documents (in this case, PDFs from the specified directory) and creating a vector representation of those documents using the Google Generative AI embeddings.\n",
    "        It uses the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to divide documents into manageable chunks, which are then converted into vectors using FAISS. This allows for efficient similarity searches later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Handling User Input:\n",
    "        When the user clicks the \"Start Documents Embedding\" button, the vector_embedding function is executed, preparing the vector database for document retrieval.\n",
    "        Once the user inputs a question, a retrieval chain is created using the stored vectors and the document chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Response Generation:\n",
    "        The response is generated based on the input question and the relevant document context. The processing time for generating the response is measured and displayed.\n",
    "        An expander is provided to show the relevant chunks of documents that contributed to the answer, improving transparency and allowing users to see the basis for the modelâ€™s responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Achievements and Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "    Functionality: The application allows users to ask questions related to a set of documents (e.g., US Census data in PDF format). It retrieves and utilizes the context of these documents to generate accurate answers based on the user's input.\n",
    "    Efficiency: By using FAISS for vector storage, the application can quickly find relevant document chunks, making the Q&A process faster and more efficient.\n",
    "    User Engagement: The inclusion of an expander to display relevant document content helps users understand how the model arrived at its answers, fostering trust in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use the Gemini API Key?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Advanced Language Processing: The Gemini model, accessed through the Groq API, leverages advanced natural language processing capabilities to provide more nuanced and context-aware answers compared to traditional models. This is particularly beneficial for complex queries that require a deep understanding of the provided documents.\n",
    "    Integration Flexibility: The use of the Groq API allows for seamless integration of various models and embeddings, making it easier to switch or upgrade the underlying model as needed without significant changes to the codebase.\n",
    "    Secure Access: Storing the API key as an environment variable ensures that sensitive credentials are not hard-coded into the application, enhancing security and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this Streamlit application effectively utilizes modern language processing techniques to create a responsive and informative Q&A system, leveraging the power of embeddings and the Gemini model for enhanced user interaction."
